[Schematic](fpga_blaster_schem_v0_8.pdf)

### Digital constant current capacitive discharge launch controller.

Powered by 2xAA Lithium batteries, the controller charges a 200uF capactor bank to 320V with a flyback converter giving 10 Joules of energy.
The capacitor is PWM discharged through a 390uH inductor in series with the extension cable and rocket igniter.
Discharge is digitally current controlled as a buck converter with selectable current setting of 1 to 6 Amps.

An analog front end is used to isolate, instrument and digitize the capacitor and inductor voltages and currents at 3 Mhz continously. 
The PWM signal is generated by a control loop running at 48 Mhz. The control loop models the inductor/output current based on the measured voltages
and PWM signal, with PWM switching when the current rises/falls above/below the target current margins.

## FPGA Selection

The MAX-10 FPGAs from Intel/ALtera were selected as a) free tools were available and b) low cost devices and c) the instant-on (10mSec) boot time.
The 144 pin quad flat pack was chosen as it is hand solderable and probable. Devices from 2K to 25K logic cells are avaialable in pin compatible packages.
The free tools support System Verilog design input, and provide support integrating device specific features including differential and DDR IO and PLLs for clock generation.
